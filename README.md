# EMI_THERAPEUTIC-GAMING
This repository contains the implementation of EMI, a therapeutic gamification project in healthcare, integrating Python, Pygame, and Arduino. The project leverages a Bio Amp Muscle Candy Module to monitor muscle activity and provide real-time feedback to enhance patient engagement and promote wellness.

Project Overview
The EMI system combines biomedical monitoring and gamification to provide patients with an engaging therapeutic experience. This system uses muscle activity data, collected via the Bio Amp Muscle Candy Module, to interact with a Python-based game developed using Pygame.

Key Objectives
Health Monitoring: Use muscle signals to assess physical activity levels.
Interactive Therapy: Translate real-world muscle activity into game controls, promoting rehabilitation and engagement.
Data Collection and Feedback: Provide visual and analytical feedback for users and healthcare providers.
Components and Tools
Hardware Components
Arduino Uno: Microcontroller for interfacing the sensors.
Bio Amp Muscle Candy Module: For acquiring EMG (Electromyography) signals from muscles.
Connecting Wires: For circuit connections.
Breadboard: For prototyping.
Power Supply: To power the Arduino Uno and sensors.

Software Tools
Python: For developing the game and processing muscle data.
Pygame: For creating the therapeutic game interface.
Arduino IDE: For programming and interfacing the Arduino Uno.
Serial Communication: To transmit EMG data from Arduino to Python.
